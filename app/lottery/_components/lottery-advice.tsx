          Although fishing lottery is mostly a matter of chance, there are
          various techniques you may apply to raise your chances of success:

          <ul className="list-decimal pl-15 md:pl-10">
            <li>
              <span className="font-bold">Join a Lottery Pool</span>
              <p className="mb-2 md:my-4">
                Think about pooling lottery tickets among friends, relatives, or
                colleagues to increase your chances of winning without spending
                more money. Combining your money will assist you to purchase
                more tickets and raise your chances of jackpot success.

            <li>
              <span className="font-bold">Practice Regularly</span>
              <p className="mb-2 md:my-4">
                Your odds of winning increase with more play. Save money
                especially for fishing lottery games, then play regularly for
                optimum chances.
              </p>

              <span className="font-bold">Select Less Popular Games</span>
              <p className="mb-2 md:my-4">
                Though some fishing lottery games might not be as well-liked
                than others, they usually have larger chances of winning. Invest
                some time investigating less well-known choices to discover
                their value.

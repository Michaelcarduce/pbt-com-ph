          Why Card Games Have Survived Over the Years
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-2 md:my-4">
          For millennia, card games have existed; their roots are in prehistoric
          societies including China and Egypt. These games have changed over
          ages, traveling all around the world and firmly rooted in many
          different civilizations. From the card tables in neighborhood bars to
          the court games held in royal courts, card games have provided
          entertainment value for individuals from all walks of life.

          Card games have a classic charm that attracts players with the mix of
          luck and ability needed to succeed. Card games let players exercise
          strategy, bluffing, and decision-makingâ€”qualities unlike those of
          games of pure chance that draw players back for more. Because these
          games are exciting and every hand can be unique, players are excited
          and kept on the edge of their seats.

          helped card games keep growing steadily. With so many interesting new
          variations and features meant to keep the action fresh and
          entertaining, the digital revolution has made it simpler than ever for
          players to enjoy their preferred card games from home.

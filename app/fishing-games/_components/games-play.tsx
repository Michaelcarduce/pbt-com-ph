            Spend some time learning the game UI before you begin to play.
            Though most fishing games have easy controls, it's crucial to know
            how the fishing line operates, how to modify your bets, and where to
            locate game-specific bonuses and features. Every game also features
            a help section so you may quickly find guidelines and regulations to
            enhance your gameplay.

          </h3>
          <p className="mb-2 md:my-4">
            Start fishing after you feel at ease with the game! Aim, shot, and
            capture fish with the controls. Your odds of landing uncommon and
            valuable fish increase with increasing accuracy of your shots.
            Playing will allow you to unlock several levels and fantastic
            bonuses, therefore enhancing the game's excitement. As you pursue
            down the largest catches and reel in huge prizes, savor the
            adrenaline surge!
